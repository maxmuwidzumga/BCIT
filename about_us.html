			<h2>About Us</h2>
			
			<a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/duck-family-free-stock-image-imagefree191556" target="_blank"><img src="images/family.jpg" alt="duck family of six" width="304" height="209" class="floatleft"/></a>
			
			<p>We are a family owned and operated business. We homeschool our four daughters, and the Teahouse is one of our ongoing life projects. We appreciate the many challenges, and learning opportunities we receive from running such a business. </p>
			
			<h3>Our Commitments</h3>
			<p>15% of ALL the purchases made at Autumn Teahouse go towards local non-profit organizations. We choose to support organizations that actively protect wildlife and habitats through education, campaigns, and hands on restoration efforts depend on donations to operate. The Autumn Teahouse sources its teas and ingredients directly from fair labor gardens that pay farmers and workers fair wages that allow their families to thrive. Over half of our teas are sourced from Fair Trade Certifiedâ„¢ gardens, which empower tea growers to invest Fair Trade premiums back into their communities. </p>
